Wednesday Sept 30 - Thursday October 1st
1 hour?
Caught up with what the group discussed in the first meeting meeting while I dealt with my vehicle being broken in to.


Wednesday Oct 7th, 2015.
12:34pm - 1:31pm
Waited for group to arrive at the designated meeting spot.
Discussed the pros and cons of each of the ideas that were presented for a project.
After extensively discussing the Hearthstone bot (
presented by Eli) and the App Finder (presented by Mari ) we decided that our iteration of an App Finder was more feasible, collaborative, and unique.
I gave input from a programming perspective as to what we should/could feasibly use to achieve our goal of creating a collaborative,ever evolving App Finder as well as how time constraints and prior knowledge would limit our ability to create a bot with so many variables.
Good discussion overall.
